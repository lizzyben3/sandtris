# SANDTRIS


Welcome to my publicly posted sandtris! This is originally designed to be a way to play if sandtris.com isn't working. Full credit for code goes to Kochhan, of whose code I used to add sandtris to the site.


CURRENT LINK AS OF NOW (if link doesn't work try adding 1 to the url after "lizzyben.")
